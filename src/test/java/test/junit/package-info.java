/**
 * In this package we keep all the <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a>
 * tests for our source codes. </p>
 * <p>
 * Unit tests are classes that can automatically be executed by a testing
 * framework. Each unit test class can have multiple test cases and each
 * such test case checks whether one particular method or interaction of a
 * tested class behaves as it should behave. For example, one could test
 * the {@link java.lang.String#concat(java.lang.String)} method by creating
 * two strings {@code a} and {@code b} and checking whether a
 * <code>a.concat(b).equals(a + b)</code>. Unit testing frameworks are able
 * to run many such tests and to create reports. If a test fails, it means
 * that there is an error. If no test fails, it does not mean that there is
 * no error. Still, having many test cases and having them succeed is a
 * good indicator for a healthy project. The more aspects and classes of a
 * project are covered with tests, the better.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The hierarchy of the sub-packages within this package reflects the
 * source package hierarchy, i.e., package
 * {@link test.junit.org.optimizationBenchmarking.utils.text.transformations}
 * contains the tests for the classes in package
 * {@link org.optimizationBenchmarking.utils.text.transformations}.
 * </p>
