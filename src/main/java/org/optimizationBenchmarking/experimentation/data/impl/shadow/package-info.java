 * Shadow elements of the Experiment Data API are created with the hope to
 * allow for grouping of data elements. These groups should implement the
 * same interfaces as the original elements, but will have another
 * hierarchical structure. However, they share the same information, such
 * as benchmark instance names, and may even share attributes.
